# pywin32 & pywinauto>=0.4.0 are Win32 UI test dependencies that have been
# excluded from this file as they are quite expensive to install, and they
# are not useful on the Appveyor Win32 builds since the relevant UI tests
# also require accessing the menu of the console window, which doesnt exist
# in the Appveyor environment.
